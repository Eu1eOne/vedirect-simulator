# VE-Direct simulator

This is a simple sketch for the arduino that pretends to be a BMV. It
implements just enough to keep vedirect-dbus happy.

It also serves as a good example on how to work out the required checksum.

I use [Arduino-Makefile][arduino-make] for building, though you can also
build this in the arduino IDE.
